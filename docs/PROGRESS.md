# Kestro — Progress

Operational tracker for where the project actually stands. Not a duplicate of
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/PRODUCT.md, docs/WORKFLOW.md, docs/SECURITY.md, or
docs/ROADMAP.md — those remain the source of truth for design; this file
tracks state, history, and what's left. Update it at the completion of each
major milestone.

## Project identity

**Kestro** — SOC Operations & Investigation Platform. Modular monolith:
Next.js frontend (not yet built on), NestJS backend, PostgreSQL via Prisma.
See docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for the full stack decision.

## Current stage

Milestone 1 (manual investigation workspace), in progress. Foundation, Auth,
Users, Alerts, and Cases are done. Timeline and Evidence (as their own
modules, distinct from the Cases-owned writes already happening into those
tables) are next.

## Current checkpoint

- Git: `c2ee828` on `main` (pushed to origin) plus the uncommitted Cases
  module implementation described below — not yet committed/pushed as of
  this writing.
- Working tree: Cases module added, verified, not yet committed.

## Module status

| Module | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Foundation (DB schema) | Done | users, alerts, cases, case_alerts, timeline_events, evidence tables + enums, all UUID PK |
| Auth | Done | JWT access/refresh, refresh-token rotation + revocation, RolesGuard infra |
| Users | Done | CRUD, Lead-gated management, soft-delete (`disabledAt`) |
| Alerts | Done | create/list/get/dismiss; case-linking explicitly deferred |
| Cases | Done | full lifecycle state machine, assignment/reassignment, escalation, alert-linking (both at creation and post-creation), visibility scoping. Zero schema changes — the Milestone-1 foundation schema already covered everything needed. |
| Timeline | Partially exists | `timeline_events` is written by Cases (creation, transitions, alert links, reassignment) — no dedicated Timeline module/read-API exists yet (e.g. no `GET /cases/:id/timeline`). |
| Evidence | Not started | depends on Cases (done) — no blocker now |
| Investigations, Playbooks, Knowledge, AI, Integrations | Not scoped | future phases per docs/ROADMAP.md — do not scaffold |

## Key architectural/domain decisions already made

- **Primary keys**: UUID across all Milestone 1 tables, `@default(uuid())` (client-side generation, not DB-side).
- **Evidence type enum**: `LOG, SCREENSHOT, FILE, URL, COMMAND_OUTPUT, OTHER` (settles the open question in docs/ROADMAP.md).
- **Auth strategy**: short-lived JWT access tokens + long-lived refresh tokens; refresh tokens are server-side revocable via a `refresh_tokens` table keyed by the JWT's own `jti` (rotated on every use); **no** access-token denylist.
- **Alert–Case relationship**: many-to-many-shaped `case_alerts` join table, constrained to one case per alert via a unique index on `alert_id` (settles the open question in docs/ROADMAP.md — still revisitable later per that doc).
- **User soft-delete**: `users.disabledAt` (nullable) instead of hard delete — preserves case/evidence/timeline attribution permanently. Disabling blocks login/refresh/`/auth/me` immediately; a still-valid access token issued before disabling keeps working until its own (short) expiry.
- **User management authorization**: Lead-only for create, role changes, and disable. Any authenticated user can list/view users and update their own name/password (password change requires `currentPassword`; a Lead resetting someone else's password does not).
- **Alert dismissal audit**: `alerts.dismissedById` + `alerts.dismissedAt` added (nullable, required together with the pre-existing `dismissReason` via a CHECK constraint) because `timeline_events.case_id` is required and a dismissed-but-never-linked alert never has a case — docs/SECURITY.md's "who/what/when" for dismissal couldn't otherwise be satisfied.
- **Alert case-linking is out of scope until Cases exists**: no link endpoint, no stub method. `AlertStatus.linked` and `case_alerts` stay unreachable until the Cases module implements the full link transaction (create/attach case, write case_alerts, flip alert status, write timeline event).
- **Alerts have no role gating**: no visibility/ownership scoping in the docs (unlike Cases), so any authenticated Analyst or Lead can create/list/view/dismiss. Contrast with Users, where account management is genuinely Lead-only.
- **Alerts mutate only through named actions** (currently just `dismiss`), not a generic PATCH — mirrors the Case lifecycle's action-based design instead of raw field CRUD.
- **Test strategy**: Prisma 7's WASM query compiler can't load under Jest's CJS runtime, so `PrismaService` is always mocked (in-memory fakes) in unit/e2e tests. Real DB behavior (migrations, CHECK constraints, FK behavior) is verified separately via direct `psql`/manual smoke-testing against the dedicated `kestro-postgres-dev` container, not through Jest.
- **Dev database**: dedicated `kestro-postgres-dev` container, `kestro_dev` on `localhost:5433` — never shared with any other Postgres instance. Always confirmed via `SELECT current_database()` before schema-touching commands.
- **Case lifecycle is one generic `POST /cases/:id/transitions {action}` endpoint**, not 9 dedicated routes — backed by an explicit `(action, fromStatus) → {toStatus, roles}` lookup table matching docs/WORKFLOW.md's 9-row transition table exactly (an action name alone doesn't determine the transition: `escalate` is valid from two different states). No client-suppliable status field anywhere; every transition is validated against this closed table.
- **Case creation's timeline event reuses `status_change`** with `content: {action: 'create', from: null, to: 'OPEN'}` rather than adding a new `TimelineEventType.case_created` enum value — no schema change, and it's queryable as one type for a case's full status history including its birth.
- **Case reassignment produces a timeline event** (type `note`, `content: {event: 'assignee_changed', fromAssigneeId, toAssigneeId}`) even though docs/SECURITY.md's literal audit-required list doesn't name it — decided in favor of audit completeness over the narrowest reading of the doc.
- **Case assignment-at-creation mirrors the reassignment rule**: an Analyst creating a case may only self-assign; a Lead may assign to anyone. This extends docs/WORKFLOW.md's explicit "reassignment is Lead-only" rule to creation time by inference (not stated separately in the docs).
- **Case visibility is a hard server-side boundary, not a filter**: an Analyst's `GET /cases` list is always scoped to their own `assigneeId` regardless of query params; a Lead sees everything and can filter by any `assigneeId`.
- **Linking an alert to a case is now fully implemented** (both at case creation via `alertIds` and post-creation via `POST /cases/:id/alerts`), resolving the deferral noted in the Alerts milestone. A resolved case cannot receive new alert links; only `status: new` alerts can be linked.
- **No severity/title editing on cases** — not called for by any doc; only reassignment (Lead-only, independent of state) exists as a non-lifecycle mutation.

## Important decisions still pending

- **API versioning**: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md says "REST (versioned, JSON)" but no version prefix exists on any route (`/auth/...`, `/users/...`, `/alerts/...`, `/cases/...`). Flagged three times now as a pre-existing gap, not yet resolved.
- **Alert creation has no actor field** (`createdById`) — docs/SECURITY.md's audit list names dismissal and linking, not creation, and docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's alerts table doesn't include one. Left as-is; worth confirming this is intentional rather than a doc oversight.
- **No dedicated Timeline read-API yet** — `timeline_events` rows exist and are being written correctly by Cases, but there's no `GET /cases/:id/timeline` (or similar) endpoint to read them back. Case detail responses do not currently include timeline history, only linked alerts.
- **`VERIFYING → MITIGATING` loop-back** and **alert-linkable-to-multiple-cases** — both explicitly open in docs/ROADMAP.md, unaffected by anything built so far.

## Current task

Cases module implementation is complete and verified (see below); not yet committed/pushed. Next: decide whether to commit, then scope the Timeline/Evidence modules.

## Next planned milestone

**Timeline module** (read-side): expose the already-populated `timeline_events` data via an API (e.g. `GET /cases/:id/timeline`), respecting the same case-visibility rules as Cases. **Evidence module**: text-based evidence entries tied to a case + timeline event, per docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's schema (already exists, unused). No blockers remain — Cases is done.

## Known technical debt / limitations / follow-ups

- No pagination on `GET /users` (fine at current team-size assumptions per docs/PRODUCT.md; revisit if that changes).
- No "logout all sessions" endpoint — refresh tokens revoke individually.
- No re-enable-only endpoint for users beyond `PATCH .../{disabled:false}`.
- `rawPayload` size limits on Alerts rely on Express's default body-parser cap; not explicitly configured.
- No API version prefix (see "pending decisions" above).
- No Timeline read-API (see "pending decisions" above) — the data exists, the endpoint doesn't.
- `CasesService.assertAlertsLinkable` validates alerts one at a time in a loop (N queries for N alertIds at case creation) rather than a single batched query — fine at Milestone-1 scale, worth revisiting if bulk alert-linking at creation becomes common.
